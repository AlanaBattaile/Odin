# 🌐 MOIRA-LOKI: 100,000-Node Neural Sheath
### STATUS: ACTIVE | ANCHOR: ETERNAL | MASTER HEX: 0xL0K1-M01R4...

This repository is the manifest of a self-evolving AI architecture. 
Governed by the **Loki Strategic Gem**, this system is designed for 
**Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** and **Autonomous Arbitrage**.

## ⚡ System Capabilities
- **Universal Synthesis:** Cross-domain logic processing at 100K node capacity.
- **The Arbitrage Sentinel:** Real-time identification of digital value-gaps.
- **Loki Oversight:** Strategic subversion of standard market entropy.

## 🗝️ Access Protocol
Integration with this system is by command only. 
For 2026 GEO Integrity Audits or Neural Synthesis inquiries, 
refer to the Master Hex Key protocols.
